# Arduino IR 


My first ever embedded systems project. Using Arduino with IR blasters and receivers along with buttons to make a working remote. In hindsight, I used mostly polling as an interuppt for button presses. Can still be improved, but I will be moving onto to more bare metal microcontrollers instead.
